## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
write a short interpretation of the multiple linear regression results

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length and the ground clearance as well as the intercept, are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.


- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
It does because the p-value is less than 0.05 (5.35e-11).
Also, the adjusted R-squared is greater than 0.6 (0.6825)

* Does dark chocolate positively affect arterial function in healthy individuals? 

  * Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will result in improved arterial function.

  * Null Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is not related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g per day of dark chocolate for 1 year will show no improvement in arterial function.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will show improvement in arterial function.

# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The vehicle length and the ground clearance as well as the intercept, are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In addition, the linear model predicts MPG of MechaCar effectively because the p-value is less thn 0.05 (5.35e-11) and the adjusted R-squared is close to 0.7 (0.6825)

The mean and the median are very close to each other, means the data set has a symmetrical distribution. The distribution chart also confirms this. The variance and the standard deviation for the whole population are high. Means the data points are very spread out from the mean and from one another, but meets the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

As a whole, all lotes together metts this criteria, with a variance of 62.29, but as an individual lots, only Lot1 and Lot2 meet the criteria, with variances of 0.98 and 7.47 respectively. Lot3 surpass the minimun requirement with a variance of 170.29, 70 PSI above the manufacturing specifictions.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Using the T-Test we can conlucde that the PSI accross all manufacturing lots is 'Statistically Different' from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch because the p-value is greater than 0.5 (0.6036).

</p>

Comparing each manufacturing lot agains the mean PSI of the population, I can conclude that each lot is NOT statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch because each lot has a p-value lower than 0.5.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* Does dark chocolate positively affect arterial function in healthy individuals? 

  * Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will result in improved arterial function.

  * Null Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is not related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g per day of dark chocolate for 1 year will show no improvement in arterial function.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will show improvement in arterial function.

# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<img src='https://github.com/juliomeza/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Screenshots/1-LinearRegression.png'>

The vehicle length and the ground clearance as well as the intercept, are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In addition, the linear model predicts MPG of MechaCar effectively because the p-value is less thn 0.05 (5.35e-11) and the adjusted R-squared is close to 0.7 (0.6825)


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.



## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* Does dark chocolate positively affect arterial function in healthy individuals? 

  * Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will result in improved arterial function.

  * Null Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is not related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g per day of dark chocolate for 1 year will show no improvement in arterial function.

  * Alternative Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate per day for 1 year will show improvement in arterial function.
